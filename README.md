# deep-learning-for-computer-vision

#### This repository contains Deep Learning for Computer Vision references and examples in Python.  

The `notebook-examples` directory contains Jupyter Notebook examples from various courses.  Installation should be straightforward with the provided pip and conda requirements.

The `image-classification-SSD` and `GAN-deep-convolutional` examples in this root directory provide detailed instructions on how to replicate the results, for both Ubuntu and Windows.  

<br>

#### These examples were organized from the following courses:
  - [Kaggle Deep Learning Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)
  - [Udemy course: computer-vision-a-z](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-vision-a-z/)
  - [Udemy course: advanced-computer-vision](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-computer-vision/)
  - [Stanford Deep Learning for Computer Vision course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
