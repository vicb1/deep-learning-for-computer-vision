So the validation generator will use an ImageDataGenerator without augmentation. That allows a straightforward comparison between different training procedures (e.g. training with augmentation and without it).\n\nIf the augmentation made it harder to predict the label associated with an image (e.g. because of how the image was cropped in augmentation) that would make it misleading to compare scores to another procedure where the validation data was only original images."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2) Choosing Augmentation Types\nImageDataGenerator offers many types of data augmentation. For example, one argument is `rotation_range`. This rotates each image by a random amount that can be up to whatever value you specify.\n\nWould it be sensible to use automatic rotation for this problem?  Why or why not?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Solution: The goal in this problem is to tell if an image is upright or sideways. Rotating images moderately might cause images that don't feel cleanly in either category.\n\nSince data augmentation affects images without touching the labels, a dramatic rotation would mean some images are used for training with the wrong label (e.g. an image would be rotated sideways by the generator, and still have a label of being upright)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3) Code\nFill in the missing pieces in the following code.
